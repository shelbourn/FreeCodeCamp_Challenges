/* From Challenge: "Stand in Line"
Push / Shift Functions to push a number to the end of an array, remove the 1st, and return the 1st

Write a function nextInLine which takes an array (arr) and a number (item) as arguments. Add the number to the end of the array, then remove the first element of array. The nextInLine function should then return the element that was removed.*/


function nextInLine(arr, item) {
  arr .push(item);
  var firstItem = arr .shift();
  // Your code here
  
  return firstItem;  // Change this line
}

// Test Setup
var testArr = [1,2,3,4,5];

// Display Code
console.log("Before: " + JSON.stringify(testArr));
console.log(nextInLine(testArr, 7)); // Modify this line to test
console.log("After: " + JSON.stringify(testArr));


/* From Challenge: "Use Conditional Logic with If Statements"

If statements are used to make decisions in code. The keyword if tells JavaScript to execute the code in the curly braces under certain conditions, defined in the parentheses. These conditions are known as Boolean conditions because they may only be true or false.

When the condition evaluates to true, the program executes the statement inside the curly braces. When the Boolean condition evaluates to false, the statement inside the curly braces will not execute.

Pseudocode

if (condition is true) {
  statement is executed
}
Example

function test (myCondition) {
  if (myCondition) {
     return "It was true";
  }
  return "It was false";
}
test(true);  // returns "It was true"
test(false); // returns "It was false"
When test is called with a value of true, the if statement evaluates myCondition to see if it is true or not. Since it is true, the function returns "It was true". When we call test with a value of false, myCondition is not true and the statement in the curly braces is not executed and the function returns "It was false".

Instructions
Create an if statement inside the function to return "Yes, that was true" if the parameter wasThatTrue is true and return "No, that was false" otherwise. */


// Example
function ourTrueOrFalse(isItTrue) {
  if (isItTrue) { 
    return "Yes, it's true";
  }
  return "No, it's false";
}

// Setup
function trueOrFalse(wasThatTrue) {

  // Only change code below this line.
  if (wasThatTrue) {
    return "Yes, that was true";
  }
  return "No, that was false";
  
  // Only change code above this line.

}

// Change this value to test
trueOrFalse(true);

/* From Challenge: "Comparison with the Equality Operator"

There are many Comparison Operators in JavaScript. All of these operators return a boolean true or false value.

The most basic operator is the equality operator ==. The equality operator compares two values and returns true if they're equivalent or false if they are not. Note that equality is different from assignment (=), which assigns the value at the right of the operator to a variable in the left.

function equalityTest(myVal) {
  if (myVal == 10) {
     return "Equal";
  }
  return "Not Equal";
}
If myVal is equal to 10, the equality operator returns true, so the code in the curly braces will execute, and the function will return "Equal". Otherwise, the function will return "Not Equal".

In order for JavaScript to compare two different data types (for example, numbers and strings), it must convert one type to another. Once it does, however, it can compare terms as follows:

   1   ==  1    // true
   1   ==  2    // false
   1   == '1'   // true
  "3"  ==  3    // true
Instructions
Add the equality operator to the indicated line so that the function will return "Equal" when val is equivalent to 12 */


// Setup
function testEqual(val) {
  if (val == 12) { // Change this line
    return "Equal";
  }
  return "Not Equal";
}

// Change this value to test
testEqual(12);

/* From Challenge: "Comparison with the Strict Equality Operator"

Strict equality (===) is the counterpart to the equality operator (==). Unlike the equality operator, strict equality tests both the data type and value of the compared elements.

Examples

3 === 3   // true
3 === '3' // false
In the second example, 3 is a Number type and '3' is a String type.

Instructions
Use the strict equality operator in the if statement so the function will return "Equal" when val is strictly equal to 7 */


// Setup
function testStrict(val) {
  if (val === 7) { // Change this line
    return "Equal";
  }
  return "Not Equal";
}

// Change this value to test
testStrict(10);
