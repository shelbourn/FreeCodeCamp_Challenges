*This repository containing some of the challenges that I have completed using FreeCodeCamp. I have been lightly coding for years, but this is the first time I am taking a serious stab at getting fluent in coding languages. So PLEASE DON'T JUDGE because some of these files are pretty basic.*

*I will also be posting my progress through the* **#100DaysOfCode** **Challenge** *that I started on June 26, 2016*
