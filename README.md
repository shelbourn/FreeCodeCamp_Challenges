# FreeCodeCamp.com Challenges

*This repository containing some of the challenges that I have completed using FreeCodeCamp. I have been lightly coding for years, but this is the first time I am taking a serious stab at getting fluent in coding languages. So PLEASE DON'T JUDGE because some of these files are pretty basic.*
